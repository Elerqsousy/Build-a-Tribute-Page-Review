        Percy Lavon Julian (April 11, 1899 – April 19, 1975) was an American
        research chemist and a pioneer in the chemical synthesis of medicinal
        drugs from plants. He was the first to synthesize the natural product
        physostigmine and was a pioneer in the industrial large-scale chemical
        synthesis of the human hormones progesterone and testosterone from plant
        sterols such as stigmasterol and sitosterol. His work laid the
        foundation for the steroid drug industry's production of cortisone,
        other corticosteroids, and birth control pills. He later started his own
        company to synthesize steroid intermediates from the wild Mexican yam.
        His work helped greatly reduce the cost of steroid intermediates to
        large multinational pharmaceutical companies, helping to significantly
        expand the use of several important drugs. Julian is a "part of a small
        group" of African-American Inventors and Scientists; he received more
        than 130 chemical patents. He was one of the first African Americans to
        receive a doctorate in chemistry. He was the first African-American
        chemist inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, and the second
        African-American scientist inducted (after David Blackwell) from any
        field.
